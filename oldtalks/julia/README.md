#Introduction
This is a short demo of Julia, the Gadfly graphing library, and its supporting libraries.  My intended use case of the language is as a replacement for graphing with R, which is reflected in the topics covered.

***

#Installation instructions
I wrote my code with Julia 0.3.1.  I used the "Gadfly", "Cairo", "DataFrames", "Dates", and "RDatasets" packages, all of which can be installed with Pkg.add().  I also used IJulia as my development environment.  The installation procedure for that is more complicated but well documented on the interwebs.
