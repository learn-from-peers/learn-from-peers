# Apply Med School 

## Speaker
Michael Barrow

## Description
I tried (and failed) to get into med school whilst doing my CSE PhD. This talk details the experience for those who are interested in medical school but have no background. I'll discuss the application procedure, expected pre-requisites and what it takes to become a competitive candidate. You can learn about what I tried, what worked, what didn't and how much it cost me financially and the amount of time I put into this adventure. Hopefully this information will help you understand the scope of your medical ambitions.
