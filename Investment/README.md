# Grad Student Investment 101


## Speaker
Joe DeBlasio

## Description
For many, being a grad student in the US can be rough-- for some, it's their first time being meaningfully financially independent and dealing with making good long-term financial choices. Putting yourself on the right foot early helps a ton in the long run, but a lot of what you "should" do feels opaque, complicated and boring. 
 
In this talk we will give a clear path for how you "should" be handling your money. We'll cover a little basic personal finance to start and then spend most of our time on the basics of investing.
